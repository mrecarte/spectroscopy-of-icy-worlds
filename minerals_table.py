#This program takes all the minerals, so far just the USGS speclib, and compiles their wavelength, reflectance data, along with other miscellaneous information about the mineral (i.e. chemical formula). The program also plots the wavelength, reflectance data. In the process of actually making a database since current info is stored in lists and the program has to be run every time
#This program will most likely be split up into three programs - one for creating the database, one for updating the database, and one for querying the minerals
#To run this program, make sure you are in the directory of the program and minerals.txt and type 'python minerals_table.py' in the terminal

#if minerals have multiple entries, we will choose the sample that is the most pure. We are going by this guide: https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/1035/ds1035.pdf, page 8. In short, for the NIC4 spectrometer, spectral purity is designated either with a single character for the wavelength range 1.12–6 μm, with two characters for the wavelength ranges 1.12–6 and 6–25 μm, or with three characters for the wavelength ranges 1.12–6, 6–25, and 25–150 μm. For wavelengths longer than 150 μm, spectral purity has not been evaluated (Ex: NIC4aaa).
#What each of the letters mean:
# a: The spectrum and sample are pure based on significant supporting data available to the authors. The sample purity from other methods (for example, XRD or microscopic examination) indicate that no contaminants are present. Spectrally, no contaminants are apparent
# b: The spectrum of the sample appears pure. However, other sample analyses indicate the presence of other contaminants that may affect reflectance levels to some degree but do not add any significant spectral features in the region evaluated. The spectral features of the primary minerals may have slightly altered intensities, but the feature positions and shapes should be representative
# c: The spectrum has some weak features with depths of a few percent or less caused by other contaminants.
# d:  Significant spectral contamination. The spectrum is included in the library only because it is the best sample of its type currently available, and because the primary spectral features can still be recognized
# u: There are insufficient analyses or knowledge (or both) of the spectral properties of this material to evaluate its spectral purity. In general, we have included such samples because we believe their spectra to be representative.
#Some minerals have multiple samples. We want to choose the sample that contains the most information, meaning sample purities assessed for all three regions. If a mineral doesn't have purities for all three regions, we will go with the sample that has two regions assessed, and so on. From there, we choose then choose the sample that is the most pure. Some minerals will have several samples that have the same purity. We will add all of those samples to the database as they may be different grain sizes or their data might be different due to other circumstances.
